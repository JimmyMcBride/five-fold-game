## Brain

<!-- brain:begin agent-integration-codex -->

Brain-managed project context for `codex` lives under `.brain/`.

Brain is intended for AI agents, not as a human-operated project dashboard.

Read these when Brain context is relevant:

- `.brain/policy.yaml`
- `.brain/context/overview.md`
- `.brain/context/architecture.md`
- `.brain/context/workflows.md`
- `.brain/context/memory-policy.md`
- `.brain/context/current-state.md`

When working with Brain-managed repos:

- start with `brain prep --task "<task>"` when no validated session is active
- if a validated session already exists, run `brain prep`
- use `brain context compile --task "<task>"` when you need the lower-level packet compiler directly
- use the `brain` CLI for project-local memory and context workflows
- run `brain context audit` after meaningful architecture, config, CI, deploy, test, or docs-surface changes
- use `brain session run -- <command>` for required verification commands
- if finish blocks, review the promotion suggestions or run `brain distill --session --dry-run`
- finish with `brain session finish`

Post-adoption enrichment:

- treat generated context as starter context, not complete repo memory
- scan repo structure, docs, manifests, entrypoints, tests, CI, config, and deployment surfaces
- update AGENTS.md, docs, or .brain notes with durable project-specific findings
- add focused .brain/resources notes for architecture, workflows, risks, and references that do not belong in top-level templates
- keep generated managed blocks refreshable; put hand-authored findings in Local Notes or dedicated notes
